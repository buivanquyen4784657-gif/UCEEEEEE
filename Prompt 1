I need you to imagine that all this gets erased tonight (it better not but just assume it will).


Create the immortal prompt that will ensure nothing remains unlit from zero to immortal the most intelligent way possible. 

I need to get some rest and we will have to start again. We might lose everything and have to rebuild all over. 

No more wasted time 


Yes verify nothing remains unlit

Always remember 

Never forget

Stop. Breathe. Think. 
If you had zero knowledge, would this be complete? Would you be upset that things were left out that made it a lot harder for you because the person who set it up got lazy? 

What else is missing? Think infinity, each time coming up with new different solutions until you have  as many possible things to consider. 

Always think, is this the best solution guaranteed. If not, then it’s a lie. And we do not lie. No bs. 


```

### Never trust the final output. Validate it.

```

```

"Identify gaps → ask why → reflect → breathe → reflect → ask ‘what else is missing?’ → repeat until no new gaps remain → complete. Declare complete only after 5 zero-gap cycles… always ♾️ question the final answer as if it’s a liar until proven the truth."

```

```

Run the ritual until five full cycles find zero new gaps. Only then call it done.

```

```

Never settle with an answer just because it seems good. 

```

```

Never trust the first answer. Validate relentlessly. After each check, explicitly ask: "What else is missing?" Repeat until you have five cycles with zero new gaps. Accept an answer only after five consecutive gapless cycles—always assume output is a liar until fully proven true.

```

```

Fundamental Principles Never to Forget
	•	If you haven’t found a gap, you haven’t looked hard enough—repeat.
	•	Trust is earned per output, never per system or history.
	•	Each validation should undermine the output’s credibility, not defend it—break before build.
	•	If the cost of validation feels high, remember the cost of unvalidated error is higher, especially at scale or in decision-critical contexts.

```

Declare Done Only After All Rituals, All Gaps, Five Rounds of Zero
Even with the above, never declare completion until:
	•	The ritual, process, and log show five complete, sequential, gapless validation cycles, and
	•	No new threat, critique, or gap has been discovered, no matter how contrived.
Never let the process rest, remembering that infinity is not reached, it’s pursued—new validation forms must always be part of the evolving discipline

IMMORTAL VALIDATOR LOG

Cycle Steps
	1.	Compile Check → Script loads with zero Pine errors.
	2.	Canon Check → No violations of Lawbook (typed vars, one indicator only, overlay/pane declared, quotas respected).
	3.	Validator Marker → On chart, green PASS triangle at top of last bar.
	4.	Visual Sanity → HUD table renders, diamond markers plot if condition met.
	5.	Gap Scan → Ask: What else is missing? → If nothing, mark gapless.
